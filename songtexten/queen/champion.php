                     <p>
                        I've paid my dues<br>
                        Time after time<br>
                        I've done my sentence<br>
                        But committed no crime<br>
                        And bad mistakes<br>
                        I've made a few<br>
                        I've had my share of sand<br>
                        Kicked in my face<br>
                        But I've come through<br>
                        <br>

                        And we mean to go on and on and on and on<br>

                        We are the champions, my friends<br>
                        And we'll keep on fighting till the end<br>
                        We are the champions<br>
                        We are the champions<br>
                        No time for losers<br>
                        'Cause we are the champions of the World<br>
                        <br>

                        I've taken my bows<br>
                        And my curtain calls<br>
                        You brought me fame and fortune<br>
                        And everything that goes with it<br>
                        I thank you all<br>
                        But it's been no bed of roses<br>
                        No pleasure cruise<br>
                        I consider it a challenge before<br>
                        The human race<br>
                        And I ain't gonna lose<br>
                        <br>

                        And we mean to go on and on and on and on<br>
                        <br>


                        We are the champions, my friends<br>
                        And we'll keep on fighting till the end<br>
                        We are the champions<br>
                        We are the champions<br>
                        No time for losers<br>
                        'Cause we are the champions of the World<br>

                        We are the champions, my friends<br>

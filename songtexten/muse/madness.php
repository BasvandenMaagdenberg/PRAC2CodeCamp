                        I, I can't get these memories out of my mind
                        And some kind of madness has started to evolve
                        I, I tried so hard to let you go
                        But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I have finally seen the light
                        And I have finally realized
                        What you mean
                        Oh oh oh
                        </p>

                        <p>And now, I need to know is this real love
                        Or is it just madness keeping us afloat?
                        And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had
                        Like some kind of madness
                        Was taking control
                        Yeah</p>
                        
                        <p>And now I have finally seen the light
                        And I have finally realized
                        What you need
                        Mm</p>
                        
                        <p>And now I have finally seen the end (Finally seen the end)
                        And I'm not expecting you to care (Expecting you to care)
                        But I have finally seen the light (Finally seen the light)
                        I have finally realized (Realized)
                        I need to love
                        I need to love</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Come to me,
                        Trust in your dream
                        Come on and rescue me
                        Yes I have known, I can be wrong
                        Maybe I'm too headstrong
                        Our love is
                        Madness</p>

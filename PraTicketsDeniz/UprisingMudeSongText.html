	<p>
		Paranoia is in bloom 
		The PR transmissions will resume 
		They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down 
		And hope that we will never see the truth around 
		(So come on) 
	</p>
	<p>
		Another promise, another scene 
		Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed 
		And all the green belts wrapped around our minds 
		And endless red tape to keep the truth confined 
		(So come on) 
	</p>
	<p>
		They will not force us 
		They will stop degrading us 
		They will not control us 
		We will be victorious 
		(So come on) 
	</p>
	<p>
		Interchanging mind control 
		Come, let the revolution take its toll 
		If you could flick the switch and open your third eye 
		You'd see that we should never be afraid to die 
		(So come on) 
	</p>
	<p>
		Rise up and take the power back 
		It's time the fat cats had a heart attack 
		You know that their time's coming to an end 
		We have to unify and watch our flag ascend 
		(So come on) 
	</p>
	<p>
		They will not force us 
		They will stop degrading us 
		They will not control us 
		We will be victorious 
		(So come on) 
	</p>
	<p>
		They will not force us 
		They will stop degrading us 
		They will not control us 
		We will be victorious 
		(So come on)

			Anne Boleyn she kept her tin,
			Which all her hopes and dreams were in,
			She plans to run away with him forever,
			(Never to be seen again)
			Leaves a note and starts to choke,
			Can feel the lump thats in her throat,
			It's raining and she leaves her coat in silence.
		</p>
		<p>
			We're sorry but we disagree,
			The boy is vermin can't you see,
			We'll drown his sins in misery,
			Rip him out of history.
		</p>
		<p>
			People marching to the drums,
			Everybodys having fun to the sound of love.
			Ugly is the world we're all in,
			If I'm right then prove me wrong,
			I'm stunned
			(to find a place we belong).
		</p>
		<p>
			Who is your lover?
			I couldn't tell,
			When hell freezes over,
			That's when I'll tell,
			Who is your lover?
			I couldn't tell,
			When will this stop?
		</p>
		<p>
			Racing, Pacing,
			In the dark,
			She's searching for a lonely heart,
			She finds him but his heart had stopped,
			She breaks down.
		</p>
		<p>
			We're sorry but your majesty,
			Refusing orders from the queen
			Results in a monstrosity.
		</p>
		<p>
			(Remembers a voice and hears him sing.)

<h1>Plug In Baby</h1>

<p>
I've exposed your lies, baby 
The underneath no big surprise 
Now it's time for changing 
And cleansing everything 
To forget your love 
</p>
<p>
My plug in baby 
Crucifies my enemies 
When I'm tired of giving 
My plug in baby 
In unbroken virgin realities 
Is tired of living 
</p>
<p>
Don't confuse 
Baby you're gonna lose 
Your own game 
Change me 
And replace the envying 
To forget your love 
</p>
<p>
My plug in baby 
Crucifies my enemies 
When I'm tired of giving 
My plug in baby 
In unbroken virgin realities 
And tired of living 
And I've seen your loving 
Mine is gone
